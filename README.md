# Resume Website

Welcome to the repository for samuelflowers.com! This project showcases my professional experience, skills, and portfolio in a modern and interactive web format.

## Introduction

I recently graduated with a computer science degree and this is the place where I want to link all of my projects I did in school and in my free time. I used different tools for this website, such as React and Tailwindcss. I try to make sure that it is as updated as possible to the projects I am working on or have finished. However, this will not always happen. If anyone would like to offer critiques and pointers to better formatting, I am all ears. 

## Features

- **Home Page**: Brief introduction and professional summary.
- **About Me**: Detailed information about my background, and education.
- **Resume**: Downloadable PDF of my resume.
- **Projects**: Showcase of my key projects with descriptions, technologies used, and links to the live versions or repositories.
- **Skills**: List of my technical skills.
- **Contact**: Contact form to reach out to me.

## Updating

Almost all of my updates are addressed in the form of an issue. I will make a separate branch to solve the issue and if it is solved, I will merge it into the main branch. The GitHub pages portion will then have to be adjusted as well. The URL samuelflowers.com will be down for a couple of minutes each time an update occurs. 

## Contact

While my contact information can be found in the contact dropdown found in the navigation bar. However the following are ways to contact me:
- **Email**: Samf3653@gmail.com
- **LinkedIn**: www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-flowers-96ba72281

While text and call are ways to contact me, I would like to limit the amount of times my phone number is visible on the internet.
